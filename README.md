## Hello Adventurer!

Ever feel overwhelemed by your continuously growing backlog of games?

Are you a PC gamer that plays numerous launchers, or do you game on multiple consoles?

Do you ever forget where your games are stored, or do you get sidetracked spending time on games you don't actually want to spend time with? 

Tired of reading meaningless reviews that don't actually tell you anything about games you want?


If you answered yes (or no..) to any of these questions, then you should try QuestLog!
