## Hello Adventurer!

Ever feel overwhelemed by your continuously growing backlog of games?

Are you a PC gamer that plays numerous launchers, or do you game on multiple consoles?

Do you ever forget where your games are stored, or do you get sidetracked spending time on games you don't actually want to spend time with? 

Tired of reading meaningless reviews that don't actually tell you anything about games you want?


If you answered yes (or no..) to any of these questions, then you should try QuestLog!

With QuestLog, you'll be able to track all of your current games you are playing.  You can log all sorts of additional information about your game too, such as estimated time remaining to finish the game, and adding the location of the game.  But that's not all!

QuestLog tracks reviews differently than most review sites.  Instead of using an arbitrary point system, we score games based on their worth/quality in dollars.  Now you can feel like your solid 5-10 hour games can compete on a fair and balanced scale with AAA title video games.
